# Product Context: Quip MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists
The Quip MCP Server exists to bridge the gap between AI assistants and data stored in Quip spreadsheets. It solves a critical problem in AI workflows: enabling AI models to access, analyze, and leverage structured data that exists within an organization's Quip documents. Without this integration, valuable data remains siloed and inaccessible to AI systems, limiting their capability to provide accurate and contextually relevant assistance.

## Key Problems Solved

### For AI Assistants
- **Data Access**: Provides structured access to spreadsheet data that would otherwise be inaccessible
- **Context Enrichment**: Allows AI to incorporate real organizational data into responses and analysis
- **Document Understanding**: Enables parsing and interpretation of complex spreadsheet structures
- **Storage Flexibility**: Supports both local and cloud storage options for different deployment scenarios

### For Developers
- **Simplified Integration**: Standardizes the interface between AI systems and Quip data
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Eliminates need to build custom Quip API integrations
- **Consistent Data Format**: Provides reliable CSV output regardless of original spreadsheet complexity
- **Multiple Transport Options**: Supports both stdio and HTTP transports for different integration needs

### For End Users
- **Enhanced AI Assistance**: Receive AI responses informed by actual organizational data
- **Seamless Experience**: No need to manually share spreadsheet data with AI systems
- **Data Privacy Control**: Maintain control over which spreadsheets are accessible
- **Large Spreadsheet Support**: Access to structured data even from very large spreadsheets

## How It Should Work

### From the End User Perspective
1. User configures the Quip MCP server with their Quip API token and desired storage options
2. User connects the server to their AI assistant platform (e.g., Claude.app)
3. When interacting with the AI, user can reference Quip spreadsheets by their thread IDs
4. AI can then access, analyze and incorporate the spreadsheet data into its responses
5. For large spreadsheets, AI can inform the user that it's working with a truncated version
6. AI can access complete data through resource URIs when needed for detailed analysis
7. User maintains control over which spreadsheets are accessible to the AI

### From the AI Assistant Perspective
1. AI receives a request that requires spreadsheet data from Quip
2. AI uses the MCP protocol to request data from the Quip server via tool calls
3. AI receives CSV data with metadata including information about truncation
4. AI parses the returned CSV data and incorporates insights into its response
5. For larger datasets, AI can access complete data through resource URIs if needed
6. AI can handle error conditions gracefully with meaningful feedback to the user

### From the Developer Perspective
1. Developer integrates the MCP server into their workflow with minimal configuration
2. Developer can customize storage options (local or S3), transport mode, and authentication
3. Server can be deployed in various environments (development, production, container)
4. Mock mode allows for testing without real Quip credentials
5. Resource URI flexibility provides options for different access patterns
6. Caching mechanisms improve performance and reduce API load
7. Error handling provides actionable feedback for troubleshooting

## User Experience Goals

### Reliability
- The server should consistently return accurate data from Quip
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Fallback mechanisms should handle edge cases gracefully
- Cache invalidation should ensure data freshness while maintaining performance

### Performance
- Data retrieval should be fast and responsive
- Caching should minimize redundant API calls
- Large spreadsheets should be handled efficiently
- S3 storage should optimize for cloud-based deployments

### Simplicity
- Configuration should be straightforward with sensible defaults
- Tool usage should be intuitive for both developers and AI systems
- Documentation should clearly explain all capabilities and options
- Common deployment scenarios should have clear setup instructions

### Security
- Authentication should be robust but not burdensome
- Sensitive data should be properly protected
- API tokens and credentials should be handled securely
- Resource access should follow least privilege principles

### Flexibility
- Support for different transport mechanisms (stdio, HTTP)
- Multiple storage backend options (local filesystem, S3)
- Configurable options for resource URIs (quip://, file://, s3://, https://)
- Adaptable to different deployment scenarios (local, server, container, cloud)
- Mock mode for development and testing without credentials
