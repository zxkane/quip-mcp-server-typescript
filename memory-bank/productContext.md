# Product Context: Quip MCP Server

## Why This Project Exists
The Quip MCP Server exists to bridge the gap between AI assistants and data stored in Quip spreadsheets. It solves a critical problem in AI workflows: enabling AI models to access, analyze, and leverage structured data that exists within an organization's Quip documents. Without this integration, valuable data remains siloed and inaccessible to AI systems, limiting their capability to provide accurate and contextually relevant assistance.

## Key Problems Solved

### For AI Assistants
- **Data Access**: Provides structured access to spreadsheet data that would otherwise be inaccessible
- **Context Enrichment**: Allows AI to incorporate real organizational data into responses and analysis
- **Document Understanding**: Enables parsing and interpretation of complex spreadsheet structures

### For Developers
- **Simplified Integration**: Standardizes the interface between AI systems and Quip data
- **Reduced Development Effort**: Eliminates need to build custom Quip API integrations
- **Consistent Data Format**: Provides reliable CSV output regardless of original spreadsheet complexity

### For End Users
- **Enhanced AI Assistance**: Receive AI responses informed by actual organizational data
- **Seamless Experience**: No need to manually share spreadsheet data with AI systems
- **Data Privacy Control**: Maintain control over which spreadsheets are accessible

## How It Should Work

### From the End User Perspective
1. User configures the Quip MCP server with their Quip API token
2. User connects the server to their AI assistant platform (e.g., Claude.app)
3. When interacting with the AI, user can reference Quip spreadsheets by their IDs
4. AI can then access, analyze and incorporate the spreadsheet data into its responses
5. For large spreadsheets, AI can inform the user that it's working with a truncated version and offer to analyze specific sections

### From the AI Assistant Perspective
1. AI receives a request that requires spreadsheet data from Quip
2. AI uses the MCP protocol to request data from the Quip server
3. AI parses the returned CSV data and metadata
4. AI incorporates insights from the data into its response
5. For larger datasets, AI can access complete data through resource URIs if needed

### From the Developer Perspective
1. Developer integrates the MCP server into their workflow with minimal configuration
2. Developer can customize storage paths, authentication, and logging as needed
3. Server can be run in production or development environments with appropriate settings
4. Mock mode allows for testing without real Quip credentials

## User Experience Goals

### Reliability
- The server should consistently return accurate data from Quip
- Error messages should be clear and actionable
- Fallback mechanisms should handle edge cases gracefully

### Performance
- Data retrieval should be fast and responsive
- Caching should minimize redundant API calls
- Large spreadsheets should be handled efficiently

### Simplicity
- Configuration should be straightforward with sensible defaults
- Tool usage should be intuitive for both developers and AI systems
- Documentation should clearly explain all capabilities and options

### Security
- Authentication should be robust but not burdensome
- Sensitive data should be properly protected
- API tokens and credentials should be handled securely

### Flexibility
- Support for different transport mechanisms (stdio, HTTP)
- Configurable options for resource URIs (quip:// vs file://)
- Adaptable to different deployment scenarios (local, server, container)
