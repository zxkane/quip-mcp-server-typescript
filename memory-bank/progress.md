# Progress: Quip MCP Server

## What Works

### Core Server Functionality
- âœ… MCP server implementation with full protocol support
- âœ… Tool registration and routing mechanisms
- âœ… Resource URI handling and resolution for multiple URI schemes
- âœ… Transport selection (stdio/HTTP) based on environment
- âœ… Health check endpoint for monitoring server status

### Quip Integration
- âœ… Quip API client with authentication
- âœ… Primary XLSX export method for data retrieval
- âœ… Fallback HTML parsing method for data extraction
- âœ… Spreadsheet format detection and validation
- âœ… Sheet selection by name

### Storage and Data Handling
- âœ… Local filesystem storage implementation
- âœ… S3 storage implementation with presigned URLs
- âœ… CSV conversion and formatting
- âœ… Metadata generation and storage
- âœ… Large spreadsheet truncation with proper CSV structure preservation
- âœ… Resource URI generation for multiple access methods (quip://, file://, s3://, https://)

### Infrastructure
- âœ… Dual caching mechanism with TTL (Time To Live) for content and metadata
- âœ… Structured logging with different levels and JSON support
- âœ… Hierarchical error handling with specific error types
- âœ… Mock mode for testing without Quip credentials
- âœ… Example client for demonstration and testing

### Configuration
- âœ… Command-line arguments parsing
- âœ… Environment variable support
- âœ… Flexible storage path and type configuration
- âœ… Debug mode for detailed logging
- âœ… API key authentication for HTTP transport

- ðŸ”„ Tool for listing available spreadsheets in a user's Quip account
- ðŸ”„ Write capability for updating spreadsheet data
- ðŸ”„ Document type detection for better error messages
- ðŸ”„ Sheet listing tool for multi-sheet documents

### Enhanced Data Processing
- ðŸ”„ Support for formulas and calculated values
- ðŸ”„ Handling of merged cells
- ðŸ”„ Format preservation options
- ðŸ”„ Cell formatting information

### Performance Optimizations
- ðŸ”„ Streaming support for very large spreadsheets
- ðŸ”„ Optimized CSV truncation algorithm
- ðŸ”„ Background processing for data extraction
- ðŸ”„ Parallel processing for multi-sheet documents

### Security Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Row/column level access control
- ðŸ”„ Data masking for sensitive information
- ðŸ”„ Enhanced HTTP transport authentication options
- ðŸ”„ OAuth integration for token management
- ðŸ”„ Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Current Status

The Quip MCP Server is currently in a **stable, operational state** with the core functionality implemented and working. The server successfully:

1. Connects to the Quip API with robust authentication
2. Retrieves spreadsheet data using multiple methods
3. Converts it to CSV format with proper structure preservation
4. Handles large datasets through intelligent truncation
5. Provides access to complete data via multiple resource URI types
6. Supports both local filesystem and S3 storage options
7. Operates via either stdio or HTTP transport

The server can be used in production environments for read-only access to Quip spreadsheets, with appropriate error handling, performance optimizations, and flexible deployment options. The example client demonstrates the complete workflow.

## Development Milestones

## Known Issues

### Quip API Limitations
- Very large spreadsheets may cause API timeouts
- Rate limiting can affect performance under heavy load
- Some complex formatting might be lost in conversion
- API token management requires manual intervention

### Implementation Constraints
- Sheet names with special characters might cause path issues on some systems
- Memory usage can spike during conversion of large XLSX files
- HTTP transport authentication is limited to API key
- Truncation algorithm may not be optimal for all types of spreadsheets

### Edge Cases
- Merged cells are handled as separate cells in CSV output
- Complex formulas are converted to their values only
- Cell comments are not preserved in the CSV output
- Some Unicode characters may not be properly handled in file paths
- Spreadsheets with complex cell formatting lose formatting details

## Next Steps

The immediate focus for development is:

1. Add a spreadsheet listing tool to allow AI assistants to discover available documents
2. Implement better error recovery for transient API failures
3. Optimize the CSV truncation algorithm for large spreadsheets
4. Add support for listing sheets within a spreadsheet
5. Begin work on write capability for updating spreadsheet content

These enhancements will build upon the stable core functionality to provide a more complete Quip integration solution for AI assistants while maintaining the reliability and performance of the current implementation.
