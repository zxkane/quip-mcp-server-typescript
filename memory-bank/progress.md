# Progress: Quip MCP Server

## What Works

### Core Server Functionality
- âœ… MCP server implementation with full protocol support
- âœ… Tool registration and routing mechanisms
- âœ… Resource URI handling and resolution
- âœ… Transport selection (stdio/HTTP) based on environment
- âœ… Health check endpoint for monitoring server status

### Quip Integration
- âœ… Quip API client with authentication
- âœ… Primary XLSX export method for data retrieval
- âœ… Fallback HTML parsing method for data extraction
- âœ… Spreadsheet format detection and validation
- âœ… Sheet selection by name

### Data Handling
- âœ… CSV conversion and formatting
- âœ… Local storage of spreadsheet data
- âœ… Metadata generation and storage
- âœ… Large spreadsheet truncation with proper CSV structure
- âœ… Resource URI generation for accessing complete data

### Infrastructure
- âœ… Caching mechanism with TTL (Time To Live)
- âœ… Structured logging with different levels
- âœ… Error handling with specific error types
- âœ… Mock mode for testing without Quip credentials
- âœ… Example client for demonstration and testing

### Configuration
- âœ… Command-line arguments parsing
- âœ… Environment variable support
- âœ… Flexible storage path configuration
- âœ… Debug mode for detailed logging
- âœ… API key authentication for HTTP transport

## What's Left to Build

### Additional Tools
- ðŸ”„ Tool for listing available spreadsheets in a user's Quip account
- ðŸ”„ Write capability for updating spreadsheet data
- ðŸ”„ Document type detection for better error messages
- ðŸ”„ Sheet listing tool for multi-sheet documents

### Enhanced Data Processing
- ðŸ”„ Support for formulas and calculated values
- ðŸ”„ Handling of merged cells
- ðŸ”„ Format preservation options
- ðŸ”„ Cell formatting information

### Performance Optimizations
- ðŸ”„ Streaming support for very large spreadsheets
- ðŸ”„ Background processing for data extraction
- ðŸ”„ Parallel processing for multi-sheet documents
- ðŸ”„ Optimized CSV parsing for large datasets

### Security Enhancements
- ðŸ”„ Row/column level access control
- ðŸ”„ Data masking for sensitive information
- ðŸ”„ OAuth integration for token management
- ðŸ”„ Rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Current Status

The Quip MCP Server is currently in a **stable, operational state** with the core functionality implemented and working. It successfully:

1. Connects to the Quip API
2. Retrieves spreadsheet data
3. Converts it to CSV format
4. Handles large datasets appropriately
5. Provides access to complete data via resource URIs

The server can be used in production environments for read-only access to Quip spreadsheets, with appropriate error handling and performance optimizations. The example client demonstrates the complete workflow.

## Development Milestones

### Milestone 1: Core Functionality âœ…
- MCP server implementation
- Quip API integration
- Basic spreadsheet retrieval
- CSV conversion

### Milestone 2: Enhanced Reliability & Performance âœ…
- Caching mechanism
- Error handling
- Mock mode
- Fallback extraction method

### Milestone 3: Deployment & Integration âœ…
- HTTP transport
- Authentication
- Configuration options
- Example client

### Milestone 4: Additional Tools & Features ðŸ”„
- Spreadsheet listing
- Write capability
- Format preservation
- Enhanced security

### Milestone 5: Advanced Features & Optimizations ðŸ”„
- Streaming support
- Background processing
- OAuth integration
- Multi-document type support

## Known Issues

### Quip API Limitations
- Very large spreadsheets may cause API timeouts
- Rate limiting can affect performance under heavy load
- Some complex formatting might be lost in conversion

### Implementation Constraints
- Sheet names with special characters might cause path issues on some systems
- Memory usage can spike during conversion of large XLSX files
- HTTP transport lacks comprehensive authentication mechanisms for multi-user scenarios

### Edge Cases
- Merged cells are handled as separate cells in CSV output
- Complex formulas are converted to their values only
- Cell comments are not preserved in the CSV output
- Some Unicode characters may not be properly handled in file paths

## Next Steps

The immediate focus for development is:

1. Add a spreadsheet listing tool to allow AI assistants to discover available documents
2. Implement better error recovery for transient API failures
3. Optimize memory usage for large spreadsheet processing
4. Add support for basic write operations to update spreadsheet content

These enhancements will build upon the stable core functionality to provide a more complete Quip integration solution for AI assistants.
